#summary Treating externally-compressed inputs.

= Introduction =

To compute a delta between _externally-compressed_ inputs (e.g., `xdelta3 -e -s source.gz target.gz`), xdelta3 recognizes several common compression programs and uncompresses the data before reading it, including `gzip`, `bzip2`, and `compress`. When the decoder finishes decompression, it re-applies the external compression.

= Details =

Xdelta decompresses the input stream (target) using pipes to the external compression program; it decompresses the source file to a temporary file. There is a hard-coded maximum size of 256MB for external compression.

Recognition of externally-compressed inputs can be disabled by `-D`.

External compression has a well known problem: it is difficult to recompress with the original compression settings, which breaks checksum verification of the compressed data. External recompression (of the output) can be disabled by `-R`.

Example:

{{{
gzip release-1.tar
gzip release-2.tar
xdelta3 -e -s release-1.tar.gz release-2.tar.gz delta-1-2.xd3
xdelta3 -d -s release-1.tar.gz delta-1-2.xd3 release-2.tar.gz
}}}
